It's been a struggle, but at long last, this site is finally up and running ðŸŽ‰ Overall, installing Eleventy and deploying to Netlify wasn't too bad, but there were a few hiccups along the way.

## Content

* Added a resources page that detailed books, websites, tools, and other suggestions.
* Wrote "welcome text" for the homepage.
* Changed highlight value from yellow to a lovely muted blue.

## Performance

* Analyzed Page Speed for the first time - currently sitting at 100. I'm aware there's not much here, but that's okay. Will try to keep it between 95 - 100 always.
