Hello, I'm Deanna. I'm a technical writer working in the software development space.

### How I got into technical writing

I took an introductory technical writing course during my last semester of college. I enjoyed learning the basics, but I was a Linguistics major (and about to graduate), so I didn't have the opportunity to learn more about the field.

After I finished my graduate degree in Linguistics, I spent about three years teaching developmental writing, research and argumentation writing, and tutoring students in English at various four-year and two-year colleges in the Cleveland area.

Eventually, I felt ready for a career change, and when I thought about where I'd like to go next, technical writing came to mind. I was already learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and Python (and enjoying it), and I knew that I could writeâ€”I just needed to learn more about the field. So I spent more time learning about coding and took a technical writing course to learn as much as I could.

Since then, I've learned a lot about technical writing and software development. On the software development side, I've started learning C#/.NET. On the technical writing side, I've learned about docs as code processes and tools, migrated docs on my own, and started using automated and manual testing to test our documentation for quality and consistency.

If you'd like to learn more about me, feel free to contact me!
